- Challenge: Redaction gone wrong
- Category: Forensics
- Points: 100

## Description
Now you DONâ€™T see me.
This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/264/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

## Writeup
The challenge provides us with a redacted pdf document.

If you take a close look, you actually select the text in some of those black boxes.
So just `CTRL + A` the file, `CTRL + C` and `CTRL + V` somewhere to get the unredacted content of the file.
