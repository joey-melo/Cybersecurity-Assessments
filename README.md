# Joey Melo's Blog

Welcome. I'm Joey Melo, a junior penetretation tester with a passion for ethical hacking.

After I failed my first attempt at OSCP, I decided to create this blog to register my CTF attempts and practice report writing.
The writeups I post will have the format of a technical pentesting report. The purpose of this style is to aid students to write their own technical reports as well as to showcase aspiring pentesters how the industry works. The reporting style is heavily based on the [Offsensive Security's template](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-online/PWK-Example-Report-v1.pdf)
