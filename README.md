# Joey Melo's Blog

Welcome to my blog. I am Joey Melo, an OSCP-certified penetration tester passionate about ethical hacking. On this blog, you will find a collection of writeups and notes documenting my successes and challenges in various CTFs and real-world penetration testing engagements. Some writeups are produced in a technical report style to demonstrate how reporting works in the industry. &#x20;

As a professional in the field, I strive to provide high-quality content that is both informative and engaging. Whether you are an aspiring pentester looking to improve your skills or a recruiter searching for top talent, I believe you will find value in my work.

In addition to my OSCP certification, I have a strong foundation in various tools and techniques, including network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry. Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy my content.
