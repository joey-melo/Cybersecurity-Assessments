# Joey Melo's Blog

Welcome. I'm Joey Melo, a junior penetration tester with a passion for ethical hacking.

After I failed my first attempt at OSCP, I decided to create this blog to register my CTF attempts and practice writing reports.
The writeups I post will have the format of a technical pentesting report. The purpose of this style is to aid students to write their own technical reports as well as to showcase aspiring pentesters how the industry works. The reporting style is heavily based on the [Offsensive Security's template](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-online/PWK-Example-Report-v1.pdf)

For those looking for quick writeups on a part you're stuck, just look at the Appendix A: Commands Issued of the report and that should clarify the path taken to exploit the machine.
